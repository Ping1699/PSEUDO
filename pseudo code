Given IP Address
first, to get the mask just look at the given ip address
second, convert the subnet mask and ip address to binary
third, after you convert the mask and the ip address to binary you just simply copy all the number 1 in the mask
fourth, to get the minimum ip look at the host id in the subnet then plus one on it that's the minimum ip
lastly, to get the maximum ip you should change all the zeroes on the host id of the subnet id to one for you to get the max ip
